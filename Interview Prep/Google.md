# Phone Interview
Google Phone Interview
The phone screen usually last between 30 and 60 minutes.

Your phone interview will cover data structures and algorithms. Be prepared to write around 20-30 lines of code in your strongest language. This should be clean, rich, robust code.

Your interviewer will ask one or two coding questions with lots of follow up questions. Be prepared to talk through your thought process while writing code in a Google Doc that youâ€™ll share with your interviewer. We recommend using a hands-free headset or speakerphone so you can type freely.

You will be asked an open ended question. Ask clarifying questions, devise requirements.
You will be asked to explain it in an algorithm.
Convert it to a workable code.
(Hint: Don't worry about getting it perfect because time is limited. Write what comes but then refine it later. Also make sure you consider corner cases and edge cases, production ready.)
Optimize the code, follow it with test cases and find any bugs.

# On Site hiring comittee
After the onsite interview, each of your interviewers (except the lunch interviewer) will have to submit detailed interview feedback. Each interviewer's feedback is kept hidden from other interviewers to ensure one's feedback does not influence the others. Each interviewer will assign a score and make a Hire / No Hire decision.

Assume the scores from the feedback are good enough, your whole packet will be moved forward to the hiring committee for review.

The hiring committee will review all submitted feedback thoroughly and make a hire / no hire recommendation. For more details about this process, you can read here.

Recruiter requests for External References and Compensation History, conducts reference checks, and prepares a packet for the Offer Review Process.

The Offer Review process:

Pre-Review Committee
Compensation Committee Review
Senior VP Review
There is a small percentage chance of the offer not getting approved at the final SVP review.
