# Algorithms 
- I believe in taking some time out everyday to sharpen my skills. Part of that is to learn new languages and frameworks while working on projects and the other part is practicing algorithms. 
- If you notice any bugs please submit a ticket!

# Lessons Learned
- Don't name things in a new and unique way. 
    - For example I was making a graph node class that was handling words. I gave node the attribute word instead of value. Halfway through I forgot and kept using value which caused so much grief.
